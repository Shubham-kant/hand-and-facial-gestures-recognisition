                                     GESTURE BASED MOUSE CONTROL APP
Task is to design a desktop application using Python which will be able to recognize gestures made by the user through his eyes/hands. 
Based on these gestures the user will be able to control mouse actions.

In this project you  can control your cursor movements  with your fingers (better with your thumb and index finger) and by joining 
your 2 fingers it will perform the functionality of left click . Basically you have to use 2  small green objects
(for example 2 green small papers cut in the shape of small squares) and if you  join them (pinch it ) it will perform the funcionality 
of left  click.

And also  by winking your left and right eye the cursor will perform functionality of left click and right click respectively.
please use jupyter notebook to run this program for better performance.
